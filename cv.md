# Profile

Passionate software engineer with 2+ years of experience in C++ and an
obsessive interest in functional programming and strongly typed systems.
Proficient in Haskell and Agda, with a desire to learn other functional
languages such as OCaml, ML, and Purescript. Seeking opportunities to
apply my knowledge and enthusiasm for functional programming. Travelled
the world for 5 months, resulting in a gap in my resume.

# Projects

## Research: Step-Indexed Logical Relation for Recursive Lambda Calculus (Agda)

-   Learned Agda via [PLFA](https://plfa.github.io)
-   Question posed by Professor Peter Thiemann and supervised by Philip
    Wadler
-   Left to my own devices to investigate question, with guidance from
    above people
-   Requires the independent learning of advanced mathematical concepts
    (e.g. automated theorem provers, recursive lambda calculus, logical
    relations), along with creative thinking necessary to solve novel
    problem
-   Currently ongoing
-   IN PROGRESS

    [parsec](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/parsec) library into
    AST, variable assignment, and error handling

## Portfolio (Haskell)

-   Found [here](https://github.com/benbellick/Portfolio)
