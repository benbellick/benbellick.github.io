<p>Welcome to my blog!</p>

<p>
  I am a software engineer obsessed with functional programming and strongly-typed systems.
  This blog will be about what ever seems interesting to me or instructive to write about.
  I hope you find it useful!
  Please <a href="/contact.html">contact me</a> if you have any comments, questions, etc.

<p class="deemphasize">
  I am also currently looking for opportunities in functional programming.
